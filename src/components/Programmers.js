This component keeps track of a list of pioneers in the field of programming on the one hand,
and the id of the currently celebrated programmer on the other. That's two slices of state!
We can only feature one awesome programmer at a time.

Find comments below to help you along.

    // the _name_ of the currently celebrated programmer, and return it.
